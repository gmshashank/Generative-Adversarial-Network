## Dataset
â€ª[Dataset](assets/car_dataset.png)

The dataset was created with 1463 images of red cars collected from internet.

The original Original CAR dataset is hosted on Amazon S3. It can be downloaded from following URL

## Training
Here, used `spectral_norm` instead of the normal batch_norm2d, Please refer this paper [Spectral Normalization for Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05957)
